# ASTA-Net
This paper presents ASTA-Net (Attentive Synergic Tri-stream Additive Network), a novel deep learning framework designed for robust spectrogram segmentation in emerging wireless communication systems. In contrast to conventional methods that struggle to maintain a balance between global contextual comprehension and fine spectral precision, ASTA-Net introduces a decoupled tri-stream architecture. It integrates three complementary paths: a transformer-based encoder enhanced with an Additive Self-Attention (ASA) module for capturing global dependencies, a Pattern Synthesis (PS) stream for learning signal distribution characteristics, and a Spatial Refinement (SR) stream incorporating phase-aware embeddings for accurate boundary localization. The outputs of these paths are merged through a Synergic Fusion (SF) module that adaptively combines multi-level representations for comprehensive spectrogram understanding.

By harmonizing these components, ASTA-Net effectively segments various signal types — including 5G New Radio (NR), Long-Term Evolution (LTE), and Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) — even under challenging and noisy conditions. Experimental evaluations reveal that ASTA-Net attains 71.74% mean accuracy and 56.78% mean IoU, while maintaining only 11.0M parameters and 5.06 ms inference latency. These outcomes highlight ASTA-Net’s strong balance between efficiency and robustness, establishing it as a lightweight yet high-performance solution for real-time wideband spectrum analysis.
