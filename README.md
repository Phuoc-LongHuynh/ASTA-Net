# ASTA-Net
This paper introduces the Attentive Synergic Tri-stream Additive Network (ASTA-Net), a novel deep learning framework for robust spectrogram segmentation in next-generation wireless communication systems. Unlike existing approaches that struggle to balance global contextual understanding with fine-grained spectral precision, ASTA-Net adopts a decoupled tri-stream architecture combining a transformer encoder with an efficient additive self-attention (ASA) mechanism for global context modeling, a pattern synthesis (PS) path for signal distribution learning, and a spatial refinement (SR) path with phase-aware embedding for precise boundary delineation. A synergic fusion (SF) adaptively integrates these representations for holistic spectrogram understanding.
Through the coordinated integration of these modules, ASTA-Net enables accurate segmentation of fifth-generation new radio (5G NR), long-term evolution (LTE), and airport surveillance radar (ASR) signals across diverse and noisy environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ASTA-Net achieves 71.74% mean accuracy and 56.78% mean IoU with only 11.0M parameters and 5.06 ms inference latency, significantly outperforming recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both efficiency and robustness. These results establish ASTA-Net as a lightweight yet powerful solution for real-time wideband spectrum analysis
